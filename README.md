# AlbumScoring

I'm currently working on an NLP project to scrape music reviews and predict a score from their text. So far I've built a scraper that will scrape metacritic and store the review data (see mcscraper.py) and attempted some light ML using logistic regression with bag of words and TfIdf to predict the class of the review as positive, neutral, or negative.

More to come!
